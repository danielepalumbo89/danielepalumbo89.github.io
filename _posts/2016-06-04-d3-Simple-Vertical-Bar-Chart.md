<h2>D3.js live version of a vertical bar chart with colour animation</h2> 
Given the complexity that the code may assume if overloaded with transitions and animations, I decided to keep the the visualisation simple so to show how fast it loads up on the page and also - building this static page - how perfectly fit in a really simple CMS.

The style adopted is very simple, however the colours has been taken from the IBT website.
